<instruction text='In addition to the information provided to Cleveland Clinic thus far, we need to request further medical information in order
to render a comprehensive second opinion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
  We will need the items listed below on the materials list, especially those marked as mandatory, in order to begin the
second opinion process. Those items that are not marked as mandatory, but marked as optional, should also be sent to us
as these items will enhance our physician&apos;s ability to provide a more comprehensive second opinion.
  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;NOTE:  
  If the tests indicated as Mandatory on the materials list have not been completed, you may still be able to
proceed with the request. We ask that you contact our Cleveland Clinic MyConsult Office at 216.444.3223 or
800.223.2273 ext. 43223 for more information.&lt;/B&gt;
