  NOTE: All medical records and reports must be submitted in English. We are unable to provide translation services so all
submissions pertaining to your online medical second opinion must be translated prior to being submitted to the
Cleveland Clinic MyConsult Office. &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The timeframe for rendering your online medical second opinion is typically 10-14 business days. However, the duration of time does 
not begin until our MyConsult triage nurses have determined that they have all of the necessary medical records from you. Once 
they have accounted for all of the needed materials, it will be assigned to a physician.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The timeframe may also be delayed by a few days when any of the following circumstances apply:
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;If a pathology review is required for your second opinion.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;If the specialty physician required to complete the second opinion is not available at the time of the request or you have 
requested a specific physician to complete the second opinion and they are not currently available. 
&lt;br&gt;Our MyConsult medical team will determine the most appropriate physician to handle the patient's case.&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Some complicated cases may benefit from our multi-specialty group and institute based model of medical practice. For cases 
in which multiple specialists may need to collaborate, an additional few days may be required.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;LI&gt; Weekends and holidays are not included in the 10-14 day timeframe; strictly business days&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our goal is to deliver a comprehensive second opinion to you so you can make an informed decision about your health or the health of a 
loved one. In the event there will be a delay in the physician review, our MyConsult staff will contact you.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; If you send materials from out side the United States, it typically takes three to five business days for them to reach our office. 
Please take into account the delivery time as it may affect the second opinion turnaround time.
