Our goal is to deliver a comprehensive second opinion to you so you can make an informed decision about your health or the health of a 
loved one. In the event there will be a delay in the physician review, our MyConsult staff will contact you.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; If you send materials from out side the United States, it typically takes three to five business days for them to reach our office. 
Please take into account the delivery time as it may affect the second opinion turnaround time.
