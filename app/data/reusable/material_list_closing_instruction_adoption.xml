<instruction text="&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Note: &lt;/B&gt;All medical records and reports must be in English. We do not provide translation services - all submissions must be translated prior to being submitted to eCleveland Clinic.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the above checklist certain items are indicated as &lt;B&gt; mandatory &lt;/B&gt;.  If any of these items are missing from the package of materials received by The Cleveland Clinic, we will not be able to begin to process your request.  The items that are not mandatory (optional) should also be sent.  These items will enhance our Dr. Schulte&quot;s ability to provide a more comprehensive adoption consultation.  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Once all of the information has been delivered to CCF (preferably by overnight courier service), you can expect to hear from Dr. Schulte within 1-2 business days. If, due to extraordinary circumstances, we are not able to deliver the response within this time frame, you will be notified at the time of request."/>
